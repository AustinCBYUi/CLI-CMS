# CLI-CMS
# Overview

In my journey as a software engineer, I aimed to further my understanding of C# by creating a Command-Line Interface (CLI) Content Management System (CMS). This software allows users to manage content, such as articles, users, and posts, from a simple terminal interface. Through this project, I wanted to explore how to structure data, interact with the file system, and utilize C# features for practical applications in building a robust command-line tool.

The purpose of this software is to demonstrate how I can effectively implement the C# language syntax in a real-world setting while managing various content types. It helped me deepen my knowledge in building flexible, user-friendly CLI applications and handling file input/output operations efficiently.

# Development Environment

- **Visual Studio**: The integrated development environment (IDE) that provided debugging, testing and code management.
- **.NET Core**: The framework used to build the console application, ensuring cross-platform compatibility.
- **C#**: The programming language used to write the application logic and manage the content data.
- **Git**: The version control system used to track changes and collaborate with others on the project.
- **GitHub**: The platform used to host the project repository and manage the codebase.
- **Markdown**: The lightweight markup language used to write the project documentation.
- **Windows Terminal**: The terminal emulator used to run the CLI application and interact with the software.
- **SQLite**: The database engine used to store and manage the content data in a relational database.

# Useful Websites

Throughout the development of this CMS, I found the following websites helpful:

- [Microsoft C# Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/)
- [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)

# Future Work

There are several areas where I plan to improve and expand the functionality of the CLI-based CMS:

- Implement authentication and authorization for managing users and roles.
- Add support for more content types, such as images and videos.
- Improve error handling and validation to enhance user experience and stability.
- Consider integrating with cloud services for data storage and backup.
- Enhance the user interface with color-coding, formatting, and interactive features.
